1) filter our dataset by problems so that we only care about assigned exercises
2) filter out instructors (users 58-81 were students)

* Now we have the unique solutions (or at least we can compute them)
  - Filter further so that only the final correct solution per student is included
  - How to present the unique solutions?

* Deltas:
  - per problem correlations between feature deltas and test deltas
    > don't worry about how many features are added?  Or look only for a whole package?

* Compilations
  - what percent compile?
