Hello, my name is David Hovemeyer from York College of Pennsylvania,
and I'm going to talk to you about CloudCoder, a project I have
been working on with Andrei Papancea and Jaime Spacco from
Knox College.

Background
==========

We are all aware that many students struggle in introductory programming
courses.  Students who don't master basic syntax, concepts, and
techniques will find it very difficult to complete larger programming
tasks.  For this reason, it is useful to have a way to allow
students practice basic programming techniques.

Short programming exercises, as popularized by systems such as CodingBat,
can be useful for developing these basic skills.  These exercises
require the student to write a short function or program, and automatically
judge correctness by running the student's submission against a
series of test cases.  Students get immediate feedback on the
correctness of their submissions.

These exercises can be useful for skills development, as self-test
exercises to accompany readings, and extra practice.

Why another system?
===================

Although many systems for administering short programming exercises
have been developed, we did not find an existing system that had
all of the features we wanted.  We wanted an open source system
that encouraged the development and sharing of freely-redistributable
exercises.  We wanted support for a range of languages, including
C and C++.  We also wanted a system that could support data collection
enabling research into how students learn to program.

We created a new system called CloudCoder to address these needs.
Its website is "cloudcoder.org".

CloudCoder
==========

CloudCoder is open source software, supports exercises in Java, Python,
Ruby, and C/C++.  Its user interface is web-based.  The most important
feature of the system is a repository allowing users to share
exercises under permissive licenses such as CreativeCommons.
We encourage users to contribute the exercises they create,
but do not require them to.

=====================

Here is a screenshot of the user interface: students see a description
of the exercise, edit code, submit, and see test results.

Freedom matters
===============

We believe that giving users the right to freely use and redistribute
the software and the exercises confers some important benefits
and encourages adoption.

Not requiring payment is an obvious benefit.

Making the software open source makes the system "future proof".
Many of the current free systems are hosted by a single controlling
organization, leaving open the possibility of "pulling the plug"
on the system and stranding users who have come to rely on the system.

Allowing exercises to be freely redistributed conveys a number
of benefits.  The obvious one is allowing the creation of
a repository of exercises, reducing the burden on instructors
to create exercises from scratch.  Another benefit is allowing
exercises to be used in new contexts, such as peer instruction
and self-learning.

Hosting CloudCoder
==================

CloudCoder requires two Linux servers to host and the web application
has relatively modest hardware requirements.  Installation is relatively
easy, and we have had one report of a user installing CloudCoder
from scratch.

We recently received a grant from Amazon Web Services that will allow
us to host CloudCoder for a small number of courses: please see us
if you are interested in having us host CloudCoder for your course.

Experiences
===========

We have used CloudCoder successfully in several courses with up to
120 students.  Initial feedback from instructors and students has been
positive.  One thing we have learned is that writing good exercises
is challenging, underscoring the need for a community-supported
exercise repository.

In the coming academic term we will be hosting CloudCoder for a
course with 700 students at the University of Auckland, which we
hope will prove that CloudCoder can scale to larger courses.
