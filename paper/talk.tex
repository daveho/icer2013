%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Background %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Background}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Many students struggle in introductory programming courses
  \item Mastery of basic concepts and techniques is essential for success
  \item Short programming exercises:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Students write or complete a short (5-15 line) program
    \item Correctness is judged with a series of test cases
    \item Student receives immediate feedback about results of tests
  \end{itemize}
  \item Exercises are useful for:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Skills development
    \item Self-tests to accompany reading
    \item Extra practice
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Why another system? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Why another system?}

\begin{itemize}
  \item There are lots of programming exercise systems already:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Free: CodingBat, Codecademy
    \item Commercial: CodeLab (TuringsCraft), MyProgrammingLab (Pearson)
    \item {\em Do we really need another one?}
  \end{itemize}
  \item We did not know of one that
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Was open source
    \item Encouraged users to create exercises
    \item Allowed easy sharing of exercises
    \item Supported a range of languages (including C/C++)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
